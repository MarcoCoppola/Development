### ArrayList VS LinkedList

LinkedList is faster in add and remove, but slower in get. Based on the complexity table and testing results, we can figure out when to use ArrayList or LinkedList. In brief, LinkedList should be preferred if:

* there are no large number of random access of element
* there are a large number of add/remove operations
