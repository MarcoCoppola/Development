## Constants
Creare un file `constants.js`

```javascript
    // Costanti usate nel modulo foo
    angular
        .module('foo')
        .constant('network', {
            ON_LINE: 'network_on_line',
            OFF_LINE: 'network_off_line'
        });
```

## Best Practies
### ng-if vs ns-show

- `ng-if` will remove elements from DOM. This means that all your handlers or anything else attached to those elements will be lost. For example, if you bound a click handler to one of child elements, when ng-if evaluates to false, that element will be removed from DOM and your click handler will not work any more, even after ng-if later evaluates to true and displays the element. You will need to reattach the handler.
- `ng-show/ng-hide` does not remove the elements from DOM. It uses CSS styles to hide/show elements (note: you might need to add your own classes). This way your handlers that were attached to children will not be lost.
ng-if creates a child scope while ng-show/ng-hide does not
Elements that are not in the DOM have less performance impact and your web app might appear to be faster when using ng-if compared to ng-show/ng-hide

> Elements that are not in the DOM have less performance impact and your web app might appear to be faster when using ng-if compared to ng-show/ng-hide, the question you need to answer is whether you can remove element from DOM or not?

### Check the used version
Angular does not have a command line tool.

You can get the version number from the JavaScript file `angular.js`.
