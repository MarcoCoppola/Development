## What is an Explicit Intent
An Intent that exactly identifies the target Activity.
The defining characteristic of an Explicit Intent is that it must exactly (i.e. explicitly) identify the target Activity. Explicit Intents are generally used to start an Activity that is defined inside your .apk. Technically, they can also be used to start an Activity from a different .apk as long as you know the package name and class name. This is generally rare. Most of the time it is reasonable to think of an Explicit Intent as how you launch an Activity defined in your own .apk.
